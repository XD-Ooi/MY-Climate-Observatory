# MY Climate Observatory :seedling:
MY Climate Observatory is a non-profit platform working towards accessible climate data and education. We aim to bridge the data gap in climate education by putting available climate-related data together, and sharing them in an interactive manner. This repository is set up to share the available climate data that we have collected, including the scripts that we used to clean the data so that the data manipulation process can be reproduced easily. 

The prototype of our interactive dashboard is up! We are still developing our interactive dashboard so stay tuned for more!

**Current dataset in work:** Malaysian Environment-related Departments Social Network Analysis

We are an open source data collection project. Please do reach out to us if you know where we could collect historical data on Malaysia's annual/monthly average temperature, annual/monthly average rainfall, biodiversity, pollutants concentration, etc. (more to come!)

## Motivation
This project was initiated by a student passionate in climate-related causes who found a gap in accessing Malaysia's climate data. It is fragmented across sites and somewhat difficult to access.
