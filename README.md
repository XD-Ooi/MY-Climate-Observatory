# MY-Climate-Observatory :seedling:

Hi there, I am a student passionate in climate-related causes. Recently, I've been trying to find climate data for Malaysia and I noticed that it is fragmented across sites and somewhat difficult to access. Therefore, I am putting this repository to deposit climate-related datasets for Malaysia. 

Current dataset in work: Malaysian Air Pollution Index (2005 - 2017)

Please do reach out if you know where I could collect historical data on Malaysia's annual/monthly average temperature, annual/monthly average rainfall, biodiversity, etc. (more to come!)
