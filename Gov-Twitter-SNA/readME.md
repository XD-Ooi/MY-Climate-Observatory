# Government Department Twitter Social Network Analysis

Social network analysis is a method of analysing social structures through the use of networks and graph theory. 
There are a few Malaysian government environment-related departments that have their own Twitter account. 
We will be looking at retrieving the tweets of some of these accounts, and map out their network structures, 
mainly in terms of the government agencies, non-governmental organization, and individuals that they interact with.

## Methodology

We will be retrieving the data from the Twitter API. However, due to financial constraints, we are only able
to retrieve a limited amount of historical tweets.

## Data Usage

Since we are retrieving the data from the Twitter API, we are bounded by Twitter's [Developer Agreement and Policy](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy)
In particular, the dataset that we download may or may not be shared depending on the number of observations we have.
